# Fix Pop!_OS Network Config

## Restore Network Functionality

1. Open a terminal (if you can't access the graphical interface, use Ctrl+Alt+F3 to switch to a TTY console).

2. Try to restore the default network configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

3. If that doesn't work, attempt to reset the NetworkManager:

```bash
sudo service network-manager restart
```

4. Check if your network interfaces are recognized:

```bash
ip a
```

Look for your network interface (usually starts with "wl" for wireless or "en" for ethernet).

5. If your interface is visible, try to bring it up:

```bash
sudo ip link set <interface_name> up
```

Replace <interface_name> with your actual interface name (e.g., wlan0 or eth0).

## Restore DNS Configuration

If the above steps don't work, the issue might be with DNS resolution:

1. Edit the resolv.conf file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

2. Add the following lines if they're not present:

```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

3. Save and exit the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

## Check Network Manager Configuration

1. Edit the NetworkManager configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

2. Ensure it contains these lines under the [main] section:

```
[main]
dns=default
```

3. Save and exit the file.

4. Restart NetworkManager again:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

## Use Recovery Mode

If none of the above steps work, you might need to use the Pop!_OS recovery mode:

1. Reboot your system and hold the spacebar during boot to enter the recovery mode[6].
2. Choose "Pop!_OS Recovery" from the boot menu.
3. Once in the recovery environment, you can access your installed system and undo any changes that might have caused the networking issues.

If you're still experiencing problems after trying these steps, it might be worth considering a refresh install as described in the TechRepublic article[7]. This will reinstall the operating system while preserving your user data, potentially resolving any configuration issues that are causing the network problems.

Remember to back up any important data before making significant changes to your system. If you're uncomfortable with these steps, it's always best to consult the official Pop!_OS support channels or consider using the recovery options provided by System76.
