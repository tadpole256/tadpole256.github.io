	<div class="bText">
		<p>So I was poking around on the web, and I came upon a story proclaiming that members of the American Military are Seriously Overpaid. I simply couldn't imagine the logic behind such an article, so I decided to read it. What I found was both astonishing and outrageous. The level of ignorance Mr. Michael Crook demonstrates not only about the military, but live in general is simply abhorrent.</p>

<p>I am used to reading articles from people who don't support the Military, and who think any one who would join the military today must be a war-monger. Most of these stories are simply due to misunderstandings on the writer's part. But Michael Crook goes one step farther... He says <em>"I simply cannot feel gratitude for the military, past or present. As far as I am concerned, they did not matter in the past, they do not matter now, and they will certainly not matter in the future."</em></p>

<p>Talk about ignorance. The military didn't matter in the past? Tell that to the colonists under English rule. Tell that to the slaves that were freed at the cost of so many MILITARY lives. Tell that to the occupants of Brittain, France and Poland during the World Wars. I normally encourage people to think for themselves, and to not follow the mainstream, but when making your own path, it should make sense. Learn some of the history and facts behind your writing Mr. Crook.</p>

<p>What is just as ridiculous is that he proposes that service men &amp; women be paid $1,100 per month regardless of rank or time in service. He claims that this is more than enough for military members to live off of and support their families. I'd like to know where he thinks $1,100 per month is enough to live off of. He'd have our service men and women in poverty! Where does such arrogant disrespect and lack of appreciation come from? He claims that <em>"those who cry that $1,100 per month is too little pay are the ones who joined with the intent to get rich off the American taxpayer."</em></p>

<p>Oh yeah Mr Crook... You sure are correct there! I am just raking in the dough... I am going to buy a Fortune 500 company next week. Bill Gates called me up and asked me for a loan. What are you smoking sir? Get rich? In what fantasy world do you think we are getting rich? </p>

<p>And to claim that we do no work, and do nothing to earn our pay is so insulting it physically revolts me. I challenge you sir to go to your nearest military facility and ask to spend one day in the life of a soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine, then tell me how easy you think it is...</p>

<p>What is it that you do that is so great for society Mr. Crook?</p>

<p>My challenge to my readers is to <a href="http://www.michaelcrook.com/articles/militarypay.html">read his original article</a>, in it's entirety and then contact this guy and let him know how you feel. Someone needs to open his eyes.</p>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Aaron Tippin visits Bagram</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>Last month, Aaron Tippin visited Bagram Airbase for Thanksgiving. Luckily for me, I got to attend. I got to meet Mr. Tippin person. He's a much smaller man then I had imagined. He has a very big voice for a very small man. He was also very down-to-Earth. It was nice to meet a man who is a Country music super-star who acted like he was privileged to meet us! </p>

<p>In any case, I got an autographed photo from him, and I got to attend his concert, which was awesome. Everyone had a blast. He puts on one hell of a show, and besides being a great singer, he's pretty damn funny too. So I thought I'd share some of those photos with you. </p>

<p>I made these photos a little smaller, because some readers were having problems with past photos overlapping the right hand text on my new layout. I hope this solves the problem.</p>


<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071024130502im_/http://tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/down_time/03/aaron_tippin/PB244212.JPG" alt="" title=""/><br/>
The stage at Bagram. Surely, not the nicest venue Aaron Tippin has played, but not bad for a war zone. </p>

Aaron told a lot of funny stories, and antecdotes between songs and while adjusting his guitar.</p>

He's an energetic singer, and it hard to get clear photos of him, he moves around a lot.</p>

He put a lot of emotion into his songs &amp; stories.</p>

		<h2 class="bTitle">14 Pallets of Goodness...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>Today was a typical sunday. On sunday, assuming there is no mission scheduled for that day, it is usually a very light day. We keep minimal staffing (usually those of us who are not religious stand-by to handle emergencies and general tasks), and everyone else typically takes the day off. Sunday is the day that I maintenance the vehicles. The vehicle maintenance is usually the hardest thing I do on a sunday. </p>

<p>Today was a little different.</p>

<p>Today we received 14 pallets, stocked about 10 feet high of boxes full of materials donated by Americans for the Afghan people. There were only five of us to handle the load. Normally if you told me that we had to unload 14 pallets of boxes with only five people on a sunday, I'd have told you to piss off. But this was different. These boxes were a part of Operation Mountain Lamb, an ongoing project to help enable those people in the United States who wish to donate needed materials, to be able to do so and get them to the Afghan people (especially the children) easily. The donations were earlier than we had expected them, but needless to say it is good that they came. The timing seems appropriate as well, considering that this <em>IS</em> the season for giving. It's good to see that even in the last legs of our journey we are still making a difference and that we are still helping the people of Afghanistan. </p>

<p>What's more, is that it feels good to see that many boxes, and to know that all those materials were donated by people back at home. It is surely a good indicator of peoples continuing desire to help the people of Afghanistan, and that they have not forgotten about what our goals are in this country.</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">It's not all bad...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I have the day off, which is a nice change of pace seeing as I have not had any real 'down-time' in about 3 weeks. It amazes me how much pressure there still is this close to the end. But in any case, I took some time today to sit and meditate and reflect on the positive aspects of this deployment, and I have realized that it really isn't all bad.</p>

<p>I have met some fascinating new people and made some terrific new friends. I have been mentored by some truly impressive NCOs. I have met people who I really hope to keep in touch with, and some I hope to never see again. I have met more Christians then I have ever seen in my life, many of whom seem to take the whole religion thing far too seriously in my opinion, but who are good people none-the-less. I have met some truly impressive reservists, and some truly unimpressive active duty guys, which has helped break down many stereotypes for me.</p>

<p>I have seen some amazing views. I have seen views of mountains and valleys that most people will never get to see. I have gotten to travel over every type of terrain imaginable, in almost every type of vehicle imaginable. I have lived scenes that most people will only see in movies. I have had experiences which have given me a new appreciation for life, and all that I have.</p>

<p>I have had the opportunity to truly help people. I have fed the hungry, clothed the cold, and help provide medical care for the sick, wounded and weary. What is amazing though, is that I think each of these experiences has helped me more than it has helped them.</p>

<p>I have a whole new appreciation for the Navy! I now know beyond ANY shadow of a doubt, that I joined the right branch for me. The Army is WAY too politically correct and Christian for my taste, the Marines are WAY too serious, the Air Force is FAR too sensitive and squishy. The Navy is the way to go for a fella who likes drinkin', fightin', travelin' and chasin' women!</p>

<p>I will leave the country Financially, Physically and Spiritually more well off then I came. I will leave debt free with a nice little savings. It's easy to save money when you have nothing to spend it on, even when you are helping family at home. Despite some serious hearing loss, and some scrapes and bruises, I am in better shape than I was when I came. Spending a lot of time in the gym, and time walking around in full 'battle-rattle' will definately keep you strong. Spiritually I have had a lot of time to read, think and meditate while I have been here. I have read much of the Qur'an and the Bible while I have been here, and I have realized that I don't really buy into either. I have discovered that there is a name for my spiritual beliefs... I discovered that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism">Deist</a>. I have deeply explored and read the teachings of the Dalai Lama, and I have discovered the true value of reason over blind-faith. I have learned a new appreciation for my fellow man, and the value of striving to do no harm. I have learned the negative aspects of attachment, and have worked hard to free myself of them.</p>

<p>I have discovered that fear, while natural, need not be debilitating. If handled correctly it can be empowering.</p>

<p>I have also gained a new appreciation for my mother, who worked so long and so hard to make me the man I am today, and also for my first true Mentor, HTCM(RET) Betterton. A man who met me when I was at a truly low point in my career. A man who I didn't know from Joseph, but who saw something in me. He managed to see enough in me that he took the risk of taking me under his wing. He taught me valuable lessons about leadership and life. He taught me how to pick my battles. He taught me many lessons that I directly attribute to my survival in this country.</p>

<p>So indeed, after much reflection I have realized that I am taking away from this experience far more positive things than negative. If I had to choose whether or not I'd do it all over again, I can not honestly say yes, afterall I miss the comforst of home, my loved ones, good food, a warm body next to mine, and all the other comforts of life at home, but I can't say no either. It would be a tough decision.</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Frustrating Lack of Appreciation...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I need to take this opportunity to rant a little. I need to get something off my chest that has been eating at me for quite some time. I will be honest with you, I just don't know how people can do this for 20 years. I have been in the military for 10 years, and I can barely stand the fact that nearly everywhere I go I wind up subordinate to at least one person who is a dim-wit or a person whom I can not respect. Perhaps it is making me a better person overall...</p>

<p>I am rapidly reaching a breaking point. As time continues on and as we get closer and closer to the end of our deployment, I have less and less tolerance for stupidity and incompitence. </p>

<p>I am writing about one man in particular, who I have mentioned earlier in my blog (never by name). Sadly he is a high ranking officer and somehow he is in my chain of command. He's not a bad person at all. He's really a very nice guy. I feel bad that I feel the way I do about him. He's relatively smart, he's kind-hearted (usually), he's a hard-worker. I am certain he'd be a fantastic neighbor or friend, and I am certain that he is a caring, loyal and devoded husband/father. However, he is a <em>TERRIBLE</em> leader. I can not explain adequately how bad his time management skills are, and how poor his decisions are. What's worse is that he is spineless (he always does exactly what his superiors tell him to), and he has far more consideration and care for those from other teams than he does for his own men. Needless to say this has all been having a BIG effect on morale.</p>

<p>Everyone who works for or near this man has had any glimmer of morale crushed. His presence is a downer. I just don't know what to do. I fear that it will eventually reach a breaking point, and someone is gonna get in trouble. I have problems holding my tongue some times, and I didn't come here to take shit from the Army, I came here to help them. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that we are reaching the end of our deployment, I have decided that the time may have come for me to have a discussion with my Command Sergeant Major. I have already had discussions with other senior enlisted. The last thing I need at this point in a deployment is more stress, and this guy is really pushing me to my limit.</p>

<p>Ughhh... I hate expressing such negativity but it is all I have in me today. I look forward to getting back home and never dealing with the U.S. Army again. </p>			</div>
