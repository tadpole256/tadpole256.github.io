		<h2 class="bTitle">Technical Difficulties...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>You may have noticed that the site has taken on a much more spartan appearance. No, I have not become a minimalist, I am simply experiencing some technical difficulties. I have been trying to implement some new features and ideas, and with my extremely limited access and the super slow connection here, I had issues. So I am now working with friends from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071024235620/http://www.defendingthetruth.com/">Defending the Truth</a> to help me get the problem resolved as soon as possible. </p>

<p>In the mean time, please stick with me, I'll keep posting and I will try my best (with a little help from friends) to get the site back up to snuff, and even better than before just as quickly as I can manage.</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">My Plan for Afghanistan</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>Some people seem to think that we may be '<em>losing</em>' overhere in Afghanistan. The Commander of ISAF made some comment about the next six months being decisive. From my perspective, Afghanistan isn't a win-lose situation for anyone but Afghanistan. If we succeed in our goals here, the Afghan people will have a far better life than they have known in decades. But if we fail, they will be subject to more of the same, and some new dictatorship will rise to power, and the people here will suffer more. If we fail, life in the U.S. will not change, and neither will life in Afghanistan, and that is the tragedy.</p>

<p>We often have a bad habit of looking at things from the wrong perspective in my opinion. People say that if we fail in Afghanistan, it will continue to be a training ground for terrorists. So what? Lots of countries are training grounds for terrorists, we can't invade them all. What's more, is that the United States itself has been, and likely still is a training ground for terrorists, we can't eve stop it in our own back yard.</p>

<p>Terrorism is a concept. It is a method of attack used by desperate people, who believe that there is no better way. Often times the masterminds of a terrorist plot will use people who are already living in squalor, or who are suffering to conduct an attack. In exchange for their life, they are promised a pleasant afterlife and that their families will be taken care of. These people can't see a way to improve their circumstances, so they sacrifice themselves. The masterminds behind these attacks, don't usually make good on the promise of caring for the attackers family. It is a sad and pathetic act. One made by a person who feels trapped.</p>

<p>What we must do is eliminate that feeling. We have to give the Afghan people hope, something to live for. We have to show them that they can have it better, and that they do not have to be oppressed.</p>

<p>The problem is that you can not fight Terror with conventional military forces. We've proven that. It simply is not effective. The problem with conventional forces is that no matter how much good we do, we can be used to feed the enemy's propaganda machine. After all, if the situation were reversed, if America was in squalor and there were Afghan soldiers in the streets of down-town Philadelphia, it wouldn't matter how many schools they built, or how many great things they did, we'd fight them. We'd fight them because no one wants foreign fighters in their country. Our very presence gives Taliban recruiters the material they need to get locals to join their cause.</p>

<p>Another problem is that the regular military shifts around often. Most units deploy here for a year. And while that seems like an eternity for those of us who are here, it is not very long in terms of reconstruction. You can't do long-term projects in a year, and short-term projects don't leave a lasting impact. With each new commander, comes a new priority. This one may want roads, the next one wants schools, the next one wants hospitals... All the while, the uniforms attract attacks, which forces us to fight, which causes damage, and encourages the locals to make us want to go away. It's a catch-22. What is worse is that most military officers lack the intestinal fortitude to ever tell the Commanding General that we are doing anything less than stellar. No one ever wants to say that we are regressing or stagnating, even if we are. So we spin it... </p>

<p>My proposal is simple...</p>

<p>Big Army goes home. They have done a fantastic job, and their sacrifice is appreciated. I believe that right then, we'd see ahuge drop in attacks. Fewer targets = Fewer attacks. Special Operations Forces stay, in fact, we should send more. Every element of SOF, Special Forces, Civil Affairs, Psychological Operations and EOD all have a major role to play over here. The forst advantage of SOF, is that we can operate in civilian clothes. We can blend in with the population, and do great things. Special Forces is there to provide security, and to conduct Foreign Internal Defense. Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations is there for the winning of hearts and minds, building schools, teaching literacy, et ceteras. EOD helps clear the country of mines and unexploded ordnance, left over from decades of fighting.</p>

<p>But now here is the big part... The U.S. Government tells American companies that any products that are produced in Afghanistan can be brought into the U.S. with no taxes, and no tarriffs for 50 years. I believe that withing 50 years, Afghanistan will be a modern country. Companies will come here for the economic benefits, in addition to the agreement with the U.S. government, Afghans can provide cheap labor. In order to  make anything in this country, it will need infrastructure, companies will gladly provide (read Confessions of an Economic Hitman). The infrastucture that is built will be built by Afghans, giving them good cause to want to defend it. As more industry moves in, people will need to have greater education to get jobs, which will foster the spread of literacy and math, and other essential skills. As Afghanistan becomes more modern, it's people will be more motivated to defend what they have built, they will take pride in their country, they will join the military, and run for political office, and will have no desire to ever be a suicide bomber. For the first time in decades, Afghans will have something to live for.</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">It's a good day to be alive</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>It's 0615 on the 11th day of November, 2006 in Afghanistan. It is Veterans day, and I just completed a 4 mile Battalion run with a 10th Mountain Division (LI) Battalion. I feel great. It is a great day to be alive. The pain in my legs, and in my chest reminds me that I am alive, and that it could be worse. For many Veterans it is worse. Many of our Vets are dead. They died, that we might live. That we might live the life of Peace and Freedom that we all know and love back home in the U.S. </p>

<p>One day I will join my comrades at the big PX in the sky... I'll stand before the big Master Chief in the sky and report for my final detail. I hope I don't have to report for that detail until I am old, but I may be called today... It all depends on what his OPORDER is... For now, I am alive, and for that I am grateful.</p>

<p>Thank a Veteran today, and don't forget that there are many of us over here who are still enduring unimaginable hardships, that you might enjoy the comforts and luxuries of home.</p>			</div>

<p><strong>Veterans' Day</strong> (<em>formerly Armistice Day</em>)<br/>
   November 11, is the anniversary of the Armistice which was signed in the Forest of Compiegne by the Allies and the Germans in 1918, ending World War I, after four years of conflict.  <br/>
   At 5 A.M. on Monday, November 11, 1918 the Germans signed the Armistice, an order was issued for all firing to cease; so the hostilities of the First World War ended.  This day began with the laying down of arms, blowing of whistles, impromptu parades, closing of places of business.  All over the globe there were many demonstrations; no doubt the world has never before witnessed such rejoicing.<br/>
   In November of 1919, President Woodrow Wilson issued his Armistice Day proclamation.  The last paragraph set the tone for future observances:<br/>
   <em>To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nation.</em></p>

<p>   In 1927 Congress issued a resolution requesting President Calvin Coolidge to issue a proclamation calling upon officials to display the Flag of the United States on all government buildings on November 11, and inviting the people to observe the day in schools and churches...But it was not until 1938 that Congress passed a bill that each November 11 "shall be dedicated to the cause of world peace and ...hereafter celebrated and known as Armistice Day."  <br/>
   That same year President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill making the day a legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For sixteen years the United States formally observed Armistice Day, with impressive ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where the Chief Executive or his representative placed a wreath.  In many other communities, the American Legion was in charge of the observance, which included parades and religious services.  At 11 A.M. all traffic stopped, in tribute to the dead, then volleys were fired and taps sounded. <br/>
   After World War II, there were many new veterans who had little or no association with World War I.  The word, "armistice," means simply a truce; therefore as years passed, the significance of the name of this holiday changed.  Leaders of Veterans' groups decided to try to correct this and make November 11 the time to honor all who had fought in various American wars, not just in World War I. <br/>
   In Emporia, Kansas, on November 11, 1953, instead of an Armistice Day program, there was a Veterans' Day observance.  Ed Rees, of Emporia, was so impressed that he introduced a bill into the House to change the name to Veterans' Day.  After this passed, Mr. Rees wrote to all state governors and asked for their approval and cooperation in observing the changed holiday.  The name was changed to Veterans' Day by Act of Congress on May 24, 1954.  In October of that year, President Eisenhower called on all citizens to observe the day by remembering the sacrifices of all those who fought so gallantly, and through rededication to the task of promoting an enduring peace.  The President referred to the change of name to Veterans' Day in honor of the servicemen of all America's wars.  </p>			</div>

		<p>I think it is important that everyone understands that the Army &amp; the Navy (to include the Marine Corps), are both over here in Afghanistan, working hard <em>together</em>. I sometimes wish that the Republicans and Democrats in our government could learn to work together as well as the Army &amp; Navy have. Don't get me wrong, there are definately moments of confusion, and there are many days when I can not wait to get back to my beloved Navy, but overall we are working together far better than I had ever imagined.</p>

<p>And of course, I also want to be able to share with you more positive photos...</p>

Army &amp; Navy both work together, in the field.</p>

The Marines are proud of their Naval heritage, and we in the Navy are proud to support them anywhere, anytime.</p>

That's Afghan <em>'farm land</em>' behind me...</p>

This is what it looks like when a whole flock of sheep take a nap at the same time...</p>

Local Farmers take a break to mingle with soldiers &amp; sailors. The kid on the right was trying to sell us everything he had. When he could not sell something for $1, he offered it for $5. He clearly needs some lessons in salesmanship.</p>

Afghan farmers can be very hard workers. Most don't have any sort of motor vehicle so they move their supplies either by mule, cart or hand...</p>

I don't know where this plane was going, but I got a great shot of it.</p>

An Afghan Farmer. Believe it or not, this man is about my age.</p>

The Kids are almost always friendly, they always have something to sell, and they mostly speak at least some english. It often gets hard to see children living in these condidtions.</p>

This young boy (about 9 or 10) is a good example of how this country seems to accelerate the aging process. Being an Afghan is a hard life at best, and it clearly takes it's toll.</p>			</div>
