		<h2 class="bTitle">The Empire vs. The Republic</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>Aside from the hours I spend here pondering my own personal issues, and problems, both here and at home, my time here in Afghaninstan has also helped me to begin to comprehend the differences between the American Republic of old, and the New American Global Empire. The Republic had offered hope to the world. It's foundation was philosphical &amp; moral, not materialistic. It was based on the concept of equality &amp; justice for ALL. But at the same time it could be pragmatic. It was not just a utopian dream, but rather a living, breathing magnanimous entity. It could open it's arms to shelter the downtrodden. It was an inspiration and at the same time a mighty force to be reckoned with; if needed, it could swing into action, as it did during World War II, to defend the principles for which it stood. The very institutions -- the big corporations, banks and government bureacracies -- that threaten the republic today could be used instead to make essential and fundamental changes in the world. Such institutions possess the communications networks and transportation systems needed to end disease, starvation and even war - if only they could be convinced to take that course.</p>

<p>The Empire, on the other hand, is the republic's nemesis. It is self-centered, self-serving, greedy and materialistic. It is a system based on mercantilism. Like other empires before, it's arms open only to accumulate resources, to grab everything in sight, and stuff it's insatiable maw. It will use whatever means it deems necessary to help it's rulers gain more wealth and power.</p>

<p>I lay awake nightly pondering my role in this system. What will I have to do to restore my Karma? Are my good intentions enough to justify my presence in this country? I firmly believe that most of the people who are here, and with whom I serve are here with good intentions, but I believe we have been duped my men with less altruistic intentions into a campaign that at the very least places my moral upstanding in peril. </p>

<p>I often wonder if the only way I can restore my karmic balance is to follow Peter into the Peace Corps when I get home. Or perhaps I could follow the steps of other good men, such as John McCain into a role in a political office to try to make change from within. For now all I know for certain is that I feel very morally ambiguous about our efforts here.</p>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Confessions of An Economic Hit Man</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>One of my Master Sergeants gave me a copy of 'Confessions of an Economic Hit Man' by John Perkins. I am about half way through the book at this time and I think it's great. It is incredibly well written and it does a remarkable job at explaining so much of the Geo-Political events that have happened, and are happening around the globe. I think it is absolutely a must read for all Americans, bust especially those interested in politics. I would definately request that all of my friends at Defending the Truth find a copy of this book and read it (especially the conservative ones). When you read it approach it with an open mind, and it will shock you what you'll learn. </p>

<p>At the same time the book has given me even more to ponder and think about. I can't help but think that I am a part of the 'Jackals' he is always refering to in the book, and it makes me question the motives the politicians back at home have in this Afghanistan. The book gives an in-depth account of the American practice of encouraging Less Developed Countries to allow American Contractors such as Kellog, Brown &amp; Root (Currently Everywhere in Afghanistan) and Haliburton, to come into their countries to 'improve infrastructure' and offer 'modern advances'. Of course, all of this has to be paid for by some one, and that's where USAID and the World Bank step in. The country gets modern infrastructure, and becomes so utterly indebted to the United States that it has no choice but to be our 'Ally'. The book gives fascinating examples and accounts of such activities from the 60's to present, covering Panama, Java, Indonesia, Saudia Arabia, and the list goes on. It is a fantastically enlightening read.</p>

<p>For me it is also a little depressing. I will be the first to admit that we are doing MANY great things in Afghanistan. And we are employing many of their people. However, I don't predict it will be a lasting solution. In my heart I am certain that when we leave this country it will fall apart again. Afghanistan was given a raw deal starting from the time that Great Brittain drew it's borders. It's borders were drawn with no thought given to tribal lines, and therefore, many tribes are split and divided into two separete nations. Many of these tribes simply do not recognize the borders, and choose to ignore them. Now the U.S. is here with the goal to build infrastructure, and stabilize the region and offer aid to the people. The same goals the Soviets claimed to have, and the Brits before them. Yes many good things are hapening here, but the best of those things are the result of well intentioned soldiers on the ground, not politics. The problem I see here is that too much of our 'Aid' comes in the form of hand outs. We are perverbially giving them fish, rather than teaching them how to fish. This is combined with the fact that we are seriously lacking in our Information Operations campaign in the country. Many people here believe that we are simply here to turn Afghanistan into another consumer market for our goods. And while it is true that by boosting Afghanistan's economy we will hopefully produce a more viable market here for American goods and entertainment, the primary intention and the stated goal here is to get Afghanistan on it's feet, and to make it a stable, sovereign nation. A noble goal indeed, though I am not convinced it is possible, definately not the way it is being approached at this time. </p>

<p>What I feel Afghanistan needs at this time is the work of U.S. Army Civil Affairs, the Corps of Engineers and the Navy's SeaBees, along with the assistance of the Peace Corps, USAID and charitable Non-Governmental Organizations. It is time for 'Big Army' to go home. The fighting here will not stop, until the people feel that they are no longer an occupied nation, rightfully so. All I believe 'Big Army' is doing here now is attracting bullets and giving the locals good cause to fight, and leaving Civil Affairs and the rest of the SOF community to clean up it's mess. I intend to write an extensive information paper to submit to my congressman on the subject. He is a good man, and I believe he'll listen, I have written to him before. I only hope that he has enough clout to make others listen.</p>			</div>

	<div class="bText">
		<p>I have got to take the opportunity to stop and write a very sincere thank you to Boatsie's Boxes, on behalf of myself and my entire unit. Boatsie is a delightful woman who is married to a retired Navy Boatswains Mate. In the Navy we typically call Boatswains Mates 'Boats', and as I understand it when her husbannd met her in Germany years ago he nick named her 'Boatsie'. </p>

<p>Boatsie now sends hundreds of boxes out on a regular basis to Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen &amp; Marines deployed throughout Afghanistan and Iraq. Through a non-profit organization she set-up (called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141944/http://www.boatsie.com/">Boatsie's Boxes</a>), she collects donations of all sorts of goods and sends them to us out here. What is best is that she e-mails me with what she currently has, and I inform her of what we can use, ensuring that nothing gets wasted. Thanks to Boatsie, every person in my unit has a comfy pillow to sleep on at night, and plenty of hygeine supplies, not to mention more Jellt beans than I have ever seen in my life (many of which we share with the local children who love them). So here's to you Boatsie...</p>

<p>Thank You</p>

<p>In addition I would like to thank everyone who has been writing letters and sending cards of support. I do my best to personally respond to each and everyone of you. It means the world to all of us overhere to know that we have not been forgotten back at home.</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Busy Times &amp; A Farewell to Fallen Comrades...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>It's been some time since my last post. We've been terribly busy here, and as the temperature gets hotter the work load seems to get greater. I also have to admit that I may have been somewhat reluctant to write an update. Much has happened here, not just in the realm of Military Operations but also in my own self development and my own thoughts and feelings. Some of what I would love to write about I really can't, for reasons of Operational Security (OPSEC), and some of what I would love to write about I am affraid to write, because I know the G2 would likely clear it, as it has no tactical relevance, I know that others might bitch and complain about my posting it, because it is not supportive of all of our efforts here, and much of what I have to say is particularly unsupportive of the particular U.S. Army Division that is in control here at this time. So for now, while the Military still maintains it's last vestages of authority over me, I will hold my tongue. At least I will in public forum, I am considering writing a letter to my congressman to discuss many of the disheartening and ridiculous things I have seen since I have been in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I am a part of an Army Special Operations Unit. They treat us remarkably well. I have been given great equipment, and I have all the support I need to accomplish my missions in this country. From what I have seen though, the same is not always true of the 'Regular' Army. It frustrates me to see how poorly the Army treats it's regular soldiers, and it amazes me that these fine men &amp; women are dedicated enough to accept it and march on. Some of the treatment I have seen since I have been here is inexcusable. I myself have had to remind more than one First Sergeant or Master Sergeant that I am not an Infantryman, and I will not tolerate their barking at me like I am a dog. Nothing has made me appreciate the Navy more than the Army. I am thankful each and every day that I joined the correct branch of the Military. The U.S. Army has also solidified my resolve to get out of the Military at the earliest opportunity. I have served my country for a decade now. I feel I have done more than my fair share, I look forward to going home, and building a life that I can enjoy. I look forward to settling down into a home, getting a job I enjoy and can feel proud of, and one day having a family.</p>

<p>As I thought over those intentions, I just expressed I realized that I am also very thankful, that so far I am still alive and able to do all of those great things. As you have no doubt already read in a paper or seen on Television, a helicopter crashed somewhere in Afghanistan and ten young Americans were killed. Ten of my comrades-in-arms who will not get to see the end of their enlistments. Ten soldiers who will not get to persue their dreams, and build the lives they want. Ten families who must now deal with an unfathomable pain that I would not wish upon anyone. As I stood by the road at Bagram Airbase, and watched those Ten Humvees roll by, each with a casket in their bed, I was moved to tears as I wondered what purpose their sacrifice made. I have had to watch far too many funeral precessions since I have been in Afhanistan. I have had to watch too many young men and women sent home to their families in a box. It frequently keeps me awake at night as I ponder what purpose their death served. It saddens me to realize that these brave young people have become a statistic... a number... a memory. Who will remember me if I am killed? What will I have left behind? Have I made a lasting difference in anything? And will anyone REALLY care when I am gone? These are all thoughts that I have spent endless hours pondering. They have motivated me though as well. When I leave this country it will be after much self-development. I intend to leave here in the best shape of my life, well read, debt free, and ready to start my new life. I feel it is my duty to those who so bravely gave their lives, to make the most of mine. I will not squander the opportunities that lie before me when I get home. I will waste no more time.</p>
