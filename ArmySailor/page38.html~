		<h2 class="bTitle">6 Days to Left...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I have six days left until I have to report to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. I am as excited as I am nervous I think. I am doing my best to make sure I have not forgotten anything. It is important that I have all of my affairs completely in order before I leave. I think I am on track. I went and got my pre-deployment physical today. Doc said I&#8217;m healthy as a horse, and told me to do my best to stay that way and to stay alive while I am gone. He has served in Iraq himself, but he was only there for 8 months. That&#8217;s only 2/3 of the time I&#8217;ll be there. It should be interesting.</p>

<p>Yesterday the contractors from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025190759/http://www.salts.navy.mil/">SALTS </a>(the project I am currently assigned to) were kind enough to take me out to lunch. It was very nice. I am extremely appreciative of all the support I have be getting from everyone. I was a bit surprised to see that non of the contratctors who are retired from the military came out to the lunch, that was a bit of a disappointment. It&#8217;s funny because I have made posts to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025190759/http://tadpole.defendingthetruth.com/blogs">my blog</a> in the past <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025190759/http://tadpole.defendingthetruth.com/blogs/index.php?blog=5&amp;title=amazing_tales_of_government_employment&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">complaining about the nature of my job</a> and the fact that I spend so much time sitting in a cubicle, behind a computer. I suspect I will have a whole new appreciation for the advantages of this job when I return home.</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">The Horrible Reality of War, and Man's Inhumanity Toward Man...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>There are a lot of soldiers currently stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq who have been getting in a good deal of trouble for exchanging horrid photos from the war, in exchange for free access to a pornographic web site. I personally find the actions of these soldiers disgusting and morally reprehensible. Whereas I do intend to report on my experiences in the war on this site, and I do intend to post uncensored photos on this site, it will not be in exchange for anything, especially not in exchange for something as petty and meaningless as access to a pornographic website.</p>

<p>The actions of these soldiers does nothing but to tarnish the image of themselves, their unit and the U.S. Military as a whole. They are a dishonor to us all, not because they are showing the pictures, but because they are showing the pictures for entirely the wrong reasons. </p>

<p>The photos in question can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025190759/http://www.nowthatsfuckedup.com/bbs/forum23.html">here</a>. Warning, most of the photos in the forum are extremely gory. </p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">8 Days Left...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I still only have 8 Days left until I deploy. I have not gotten many details on what I am going to be doing or where exactly I am to report to or when. All I know is that I am to initially report to Fort Bragg, North Carolina then I go to Fort Dix, New Jersey then finally I will be off to Fort  Hood, Texas before I am sent to my AOR (Area of Responsibility) in Afghanistan. I still have not gotten my Official Written Orders via Naval Message yet, and that is begining to make me a bit nervous. It&#8217;s almost funny because I think at this point I might be a bit upset if they did not send me, simply because I have run up a lot of credit card charges getting ready to go. I have been eating out a lot, and drinking a lot, just trying to enjoy life, and I bought myself a snazzt new iPod. But if they don&#8217;t send me, I&#8217;m gonna be stuck with this over inflated Credit Card Bill, something I really don&#8217;t need.</p>

<p>So far all of my friends and family have been extremely supportive, and I am very thankful for that. The folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025190759/http://www.defendingthetruth.com/">Defending the Truth</a> have been much too kind with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025190759/http://defendingthetruth.com/viewtopic.php?t=1078">their over-abundance of support and generosity</a>. I feel bad because I had so many plans, not just for my own website and my own personal podcast that I had in the works, but also for helping to improve Defending the Truth, and with the Official Defending the Truth Podcast. All those plans are on the back burner for me now. I am off to more important endeavors I suppose. In any case there still seems to be so much left that I want to do, and that I need to do but there is just not enough time for it all. I mean, of course I want to spend time with my beloved Yasmeen (the one woman I love more than life itself), but I also need to make sure all of my affairs are in order, make sure my uniforms are ready, try to figure out what I need and what I can and can not take with me (I am hoping to be able to bring my laptop), and I still want to do some las minute tweaks and modifications to my web site, and my blogs before leaving&#8230; So much to do, so little time.</p>			</div>
