<p>Navy Slot Back Reggie Campbell from Sanford, Fla., runs for a touch down during 2nd quarter play. At the half, Navy led the Black Knights of Army 21-10. The Mids have won the past three Army-Navy battles to even the all-time series at 49-49-7. The Navy (6-4) has accepted an invitation to play in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego on Dec. 22. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025185924/http://www.navy.mil/view_single.asp?id=30359">U.S. Navy photo by Damon J.

		<h2 class="bTitle">Back in Bragg &amp; Assigned to a Unit!</h2>
	<div class="bText">

After a delightful week off at home with my loved ones, I returned to Fort Bragg two days ago. I drove back down to Bragg with MM1(SS) Duke. As far as we can tell, he is the first ever Airborne Submariner. That alone is pretty cool. </p>

<p>It was about a nine hour drive to get back. When we got here we discovered that we have been moved to a new barracks. It is still one of the barracks that was the World War II home of the 82nd Airborne, and it is still run-down, but it is substantially nicer than the barracks we were originally placed in when we were here the first time. We also found out more information about our assignments.</p>

<p>I have been assigned to the 405th Civil Affairs Battalion, and I will be deploying to Afghanistan sometime between February &amp; April in support of the 10th Mountain Division. In the meantime, we are getting training. Tons of training. Some of it is great, and some is not so great, but they assure us that all of it is pertinent.</p>

<p>While I was home on leave, Yasmeen and I saw a news story about injured members of the 415th CA BN returning home from Iraq. Naturally we were both a bit upset and nervous, but I did my best to assure her that I'd be ok. I just wish I was as certain of that fact as I sounded I was.</p>

<p>The good news is that we got more equipment issued to us yesterday, including body armor. I am sure everyone who knows me is as happy about that fact as I am. The armor they gave us is rated to stop a 7.62mm round at up to 2900 fps. It's very thick, and very heavy, but I am damn happy to have it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people in the Army who do not like the 10th Mountain Division, because of what happened in Somalia, but I consider it an honor to be able to serve with them in war, especially as a Sailor. We are making history, with a unit that already has a long, diverse &amp; proud history.</p>
