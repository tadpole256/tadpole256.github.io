		<h2 class="bTitle">Busier than Hell...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I just wanted to let my readers know that I am still alive and well... I have been busier than a one legged man in an ass-kicking contest lately, but I am still here. I have been getting tons of mail, and e-mail from so many people, and I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to all of you and apologize for not being able to personally respond to each and every one of you. Please know that I and all of us here deeply appreciate yous support.</p>

<p>When writing e-mails or letter, my family clearly comes first (Yasmeen, Ashley &amp; my Mom). My second priority is updating my blog, since it is the easiest way for me to communicate with everyone else en masse. But I assure you that I do intend to write back to all of you when I have the time. </p>

<p>I want to give a special thanks to the Abiuso Family, to Boatsie of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025044642/http://www.boatsie.com/">Boatsie's Boxes</a>, and to Janet, for sticking with me this long and providing me with so many up lifting letters, and so many kind gifts. You are all great. If you have not been to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025044642/http://www.boatsie.com/">Boatsie's Site</a>, you should check it out, she is amazing.</p>

<p>I also wanted to thank RabidBadger, Heather, Kirkio and the others who have been helping me get things started with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025044642/http://www.troopcasting.com/">TroopCasting</a>. I know things are going a little slow right now, but like I said I have been very busy. The continued support and participation you guys have shown is a huge boost.</p>

<p>And finally, last but definately not least, a huge thanks to EVERYONE at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025044642/http://www.defendingthetruth.com/">Defending the Truth</a>, without whom this deployment would have been very nearly unbearable... Especially RidinHighSpeeds, OnTheFence, Hevusa, Tyreay, Nebraskaboy, Alias &amp; Jefferson. You guys have all been wonderful thank you all for everything...</p>

<p>As always, if you keep reading, I'll keep writing...</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Elections Approach and Websites Disappear...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I can not help but notice that as the elections have approached, all of a sudden many political sites, especially political debate sites (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025044642/http://www.defendingthetruth.com/">Defending the Truth</a>). What strikes me as funny is that every Republican or GOP site I have gone to is still available, whereas Democratic or 'Left Wing' sites have mysteriously disappeared... This is utterly ridiculous. They are using a program called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025044642/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websense">WebSense</a> to severely censor our internet access, and I think it's perposterous. I am quite certain that they will say that it is all being done in an effort to conserve bandwidth... But I think that's a ridiculous notion also. Clearly there are legitimate reasons to block sites like MySpace or chat sites, but there is no reason to block political sites, especially not right before the elections... </p>

<p>It's ok though, Service men &amp; women vote, and I know that I for one will vote for change...</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">The Kerry Flipside..</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I should clarify the point I intended to make with my last message. I am no more or less a fan of John Kerry than I am of any other politician. The way I see it they are all professional liars. Why do you think so many of them are lawyers? What I do have a problem with is any war-hawk type person who is willing to wage war as long as they don't have to do it themselves. I am really sick of big talking Republican whackos and anyone who is willing to sacrifice civil liberty in trade for the illusion of security. I am particularly sick of those who are so eager to send in forces when they never served themselves, or when they ditched their obligation. You don't see too many politicians sons over here...</p>

<p>The fact is that John Kerry's original statement was incredibly stupid, simply because he made a statement that <em>could</em> be mis construed, regardless of it's actual intention (only Senator Kerry knows his intentions for certain). Any politician worth his salt should have learned how to avoid such statements. However, I do agree with the content of his response which I posted in my last post. I challenge all those who are so fucking eager to wage war to come on over here and join me and my friends. Many hands make short work, right? </p>

<p>The problem to me is that those hawks won't come to fight. They will continue to send those few of us who are actually brave enough to serve the greater good to go make whatever sacrifice may be called upon us to make... And so long as high-speed internet and cable T.V. is not interrupted no one will care...</p>

<p>I suppose my question would be this... While we are over here fighting for the security of the U.S., who is fighting for our security at home? Who is ensuring returning vets are getting the best care they can? And more importantly who is ensuring that the U.S. Military, a tool made available to the U.S. Government for use by, and in the defense of the people, is not being mis-used? </p>

<p>On a lighter note... I offer the following response to the Senator's original comments...</p>

	<div class="bText">
		<p><em>John Kerry recently made a statement which the Republicans were quick to twist around and make sound bad... He issued the following response... Bravo Senator Kerry!</em></p>

<p><strong>Statement of John Kerry Responding to Republican Distortions, Pathetic Tony Snow Diversions and Distractions</strong></p>

<p>Washington &#8211; Senator John Kerry issued the following statement in response to White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, assorted right wing nut-jobs, and right wing talk show hosts desperately distorting Kerry&#8217;s comments about President Bush to divert attention from their disastrous record:</p>

<p>&#8220;If anyone thinks a veteran would criticize the more than 140,000 heroes serving in Iraq and not the president who got us stuck there, they're crazy. This is the classic G.O.P. playbook. I&#8217;m sick and tired of these despicable Republican attacks that always seem to come from those who never can be found to serve in war, but love to attack those who did. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to be lectured by a stuffed suit White House mouthpiece standing behind a podium, or doughy Rush Limbaugh, who no doubt today will take a break from belittling Michael J. Fox&#8217;s Parkinson&#8217;s disease to start lying about me just as they have lied about Iraq. It disgusts me that these Republican hacks, who have never worn the uniform of our country lie and distort so blatantly and carelessly about those who have. </p>

<p>The people who owe our troops an apology are George W. Bush and Dick Cheney who misled America into war and have given us a Katrina foreign policy that has betrayed our ideals, killed and maimed our soldiers, and widened the terrorist threat instead of defeating it. These Republicans are afraid to debate veterans who live and breathe the concerns of our troops, not the empty slogans of an Administration that sent our brave troops to war without body armor.</p>

<p>Bottom line, these Republicans want to debate straw men because they&#8217;re afraid to debate real men. And this time it won&#8217;t work because we&#8217;re going to stay in their face with the truth and deny them even a sliver of light for their distortions. No Democrat will be bullied by an administration that has a cut and run policy in Afghanistan and a stand still and lose strategy in Iraq.&#8221; </p>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Happy Halloween </h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>This is my second Halloween in row away from home on this deployment, and it marks the first of several holidays to come which I and my comrades will spend away from home. I have never been a huge Halloween fan, but I have gotten some pictures from friends and family showing their costumes, and I have seen the pictures of my comrades kids enjoying Halloween and it only serves to remind me that I won't get to pick my costume this year... This year I will go dresses as a soldier. I have two great accessories which really make my costume look a lot more realistic, they are an M4 Assault rifle and an M9 Semi-Automatic Pistol. They really look good with the whole ensamble...</p>

<p>I got to show off my ASV recently, everyone was very impressed with the vehicle's ability and my knowledge of the vehicle. Obviously the people in the picture are not my standard ASV crew who I trained with, but they are all very good people. Fun was had by all. Not to mention, I look fairly decent in this picture, if I do say so myself...</p>
