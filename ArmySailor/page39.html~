<p>I served in Afghanistan with a U.S. Army Special Operations unit in support of 10th Mountain Division, the 82nd Airborne (CJTF-76) and CJSOTF-A. This blog is an ongoing journal of my thoughts, experiences, and items of interest about the 'War on Terror', from the front-lines.

This IS NOT an official U.S. Military Web Site! The opinions expressed in these posts are my own and most likely, not those of the U.S. Military or the U.S. Government. This page simply represents one sailor expressing himself in accordance with his constitutional rights.</p>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Once More into The Breach Dear Friends...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I found out today that I have been chosen to deploy to Iraq to fight in the War on Terror. I am to be deployed on October 24th for 18 months. I have to admit that when I first found out I was surprised, and actually a bit excited. I&#8217;d be crazy or stupid if I said I was not nervous, but this is what I joined the military to do. I have a commitment to serve my country, and serve I shall. So far all of my family and friends have been exceptionally supportive. The good folks at  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025191009/http://www.defendingthetruth.com/">Defending the Truth</a> have agreed to continue to provide me hosting indefinitely, and therefore I have created this blog to chronicle my experiences in the Middle East. It is my intention to update it as much as possible, though as of this point I am uncertain how often I will have internet access while I am there. I know there other soldier bloggers, so I am certain that it is possible. If nothing else I also intend to keep a daily written journal while I am there. I will append this blog with entries from my journal, as often as I can.</p>

<p>I am still unclear as to the details of my assignment, but whatever it may be it is bound to be an experience I will remember for the rest of my life. I am not afraid. I <em>am</em> nervous. I actually feel that I have been waiting for this time to come. Naturally my family and loved ones are scared, and it pains me to see the fear in their eyes, but they know as I do, that this is what I signed up for.</p>
