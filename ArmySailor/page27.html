<p>I served in Afghanistan with a U.S. Army Special Operations unit in support of 10th Mountain Division, the 82nd Airborne (CJTF-76) and CJSOTF-A. This blog is an ongoing journal of my thoughts, experiences, and items of interest about the 'War on Terror', from the front-lines.

This IS NOT an official U.S. Military Web Site! The opinions expressed in these posts are my own and most likely, not those of the U.S. Military or the U.S. Government. This page simply represents one sailor expressing himself in accordance with his constitutional rights.</p>

		<h2 class="bTitle">Getting by with a little help from my friends...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I am currently on an R&amp;R pass. One that was much needed. It's great to get an opportunity to relax and unwind a bit. I can not wait to get home...</p>

<p>In any case, one of the things I have been doing on my pass here in beautiful Qatar, is taking the time to write a lot of e-mails I have been needing to catch up on, and the time to conduct some web site maintenace. The internet connection here is woefully slow, but still way faster than the one in Afghanistan. And since it is an MWR machine, there are fewer restrictions.</p>

<p>I am again having serious problems with my site being bombarded by spammers. I need to upgade to a newer version of my blog engine in an effort to get better spam protection. The problem is my connection here is FAR too slow to perform the upgrade myself. Therefore I have requested the help of my friends at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545/http://www.defendingthetruth.com/">Defending the Truth</a> to help me conduct the upgrade and transition to the new software. They have been a huge help to me in the past, and even funded the establishment of this site for me. So I am hoping they will not have a problem answering my call one more time. Needless to say the beers are gonna be on me when I get home... I am going to have to do a lot of traveling.</p>

<p>But in anycase, please be aware that there may be a transition to new software in the next few days. If all goes well it should be invisible to you the reader, but the site may get a new look and/or feel. It should get a bit faster. And if all does not go well, the site may go down (temporarily). Please just bear with me during the transistion. </p>

<p>If you keep reading I'll keep posting, and doing my best to make the site the best I can, as best I can from the front lines of the "War on Terror".</p>			</div>

	<div class="bText">
		<p>Obviously, even at war we must occassionally get some 'Down Time'...</p>

I hate this photo of me because I had not shaved my head in a while, and so you can clearly see my bald spot! Getting old sucks. But football is a fun way to pass the time (even in the desert heat) and I thought this was a cool action photo. If you look you can see my rifle is slung accross my body, I was not expecting the pass to come to me...</p>

Although I hate this picture, I felt compelled to include it. I was VERY tired when this shot was taken.</p>

This is one of the coolest buildings I have seen in Kabul. There are not many buildings this nice in Afghanistan.</p>

I was providing security on the roof of the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

We take any chance we get to get some rest and get our minds right. Clearly getting ready for a convoy is stressful...</p>

This is a Mansion next to the Ministry of the Interior Building. This was our second trip to the MoI, I have post cards of what this building <em>used</em> to look like. It <em>was</em> beautiful once. Now it should be condemned. I believe numerous families likely live inside of it.</p>

Sometimes dealing with a crowd can be very stressful and hectic.</p>			</div>

Chief Fraser and I Get ready to head out. I had the pleasure of taking him out on his first convoy in Afghanistan!</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545im_/http://www.tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/convoyops/01/BAF%20overview%20009.jpg" alt="" title=""/><br/>
Devastation seen from the road. Most of the destruction in this country was done AFTER the Soviets left.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545im_/http://www.tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/convoyops/01/BAF%20overview%20013.jpg" alt="" title=""/><br/>
Many women here still wear the Burqas. It is a sad reminant of the Taliban's reign. Burqas are actually an Arab tradition, not an Afghan one. The Islamic Extremists who came to Afghanistan to aid the Taliban brought the tradition with them.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545im_/http://www.tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/convoyops/01/BAF%20overview%20029.jpg" alt="" title=""/><br/>
Bicycles are a very common mode of transportation throughout the country. Very few places outside of Kabul and Kandahar have any kind of regular electrical service. Those people who have electricity run their own generators. This man is clearly carrying one home on his bike.</p>

Two members of the Afghan National Police (ANP) ride a motorcycle donated by the Coalition.</p>

We passed a stopped Coalition Convoy comprised of regular forces.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545im_/http://www.tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/convoyops/01/BAF%20overview%20068.jpg" alt="" title=""/><br/>
A roadside grave. It is common here to bury people wherever they died. This is a very common sight.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545im_/http://www.tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/convoyops/01/BAF%20overview%20071.jpg" alt="" title=""/><br/>
A lot of kids spend their days sitting along a roadside waiting for work, or herding sheep. They all watch the convoys go by, they should be in school but most don't go.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545im_/http://www.tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/convoyops/01/BAF%20overview%20099.jpg" alt="" title=""/><br/>
This is me conducting a comms check before rolling out on a Convoy. We usually prefer to go out in Non-Tactical Vehicles that make less obvious targets. Personally I prefer to look as little like 'Big Army' as possible. 'Big Army' attracts bullets.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141545im_/http://www.tadpolenet.com/pics/afghanistan/convoyops/01/Baad%20drivers.jpg" alt="" title=""/><br/>
The Shappards here have no problems herding their sheep right into the middle of the road. This sometimes creates a dangerous situation. (If you look in the rear view mirror you can see me driving!)</p>
