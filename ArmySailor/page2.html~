	<div class="bText">
		<p>I try to review my traffic logs for this site at least once a day, or at least every other day. From some of the traffic I have been seeing, I am evidently not the only First  Class eagerly awaiting the results of the FY08 Chiefs Board... </p>

<p>I've been getting a lot of hits from search engines of people looking for "chief's board results" or "Navy Chief results" or "Navy Chiefs Board Results Posted". Whereas I kind of feel bad for the guys who wind up here rather than being able to see the results they are seeking, it's good to know I am not the only one who is starting to sweat it a bit...</p>

<p>To all my fellow First Class Petty Officers who are eagerly awaiting the results with me, good luck... Hopefully they will be out soon. </p>

<p>Ironically... even with the influx of traffic from people searching for the results... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021035917/http://www.tadpolenet.com/warblogs/index.php?title=night_life_in_fort_bragg_aamp_fayettevil&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">this post</a> still seems to be one of my most popular...

		<h2 class="bTitle">Latest Word...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>The latest word in the rumor mill now is that the Chief Results may not be released until mid-August. If it's true, I can only speculate as to what the hold up could be. Typically the results are released in the last week of July or the first week of August. Could this not only be the lowest promotion rate, but also the slowest board results in eight years?</p>

<p>Mind you, I am not placing too much faith in the rumor mill. I have been around long enough to know the true value of rumors, but is certainly can be fun to speculate. In the mean time, I wake up every morning, and before I even sit up, I reach over and grab my laptop from the nightstand and check the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021035917/http://www.npc.navy.mil/">Naval Personnel Command website</a> to see if the results are out. It's been a routine I've developed over the last week and a half.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I will keep waiting, and hope the rumors aren't true...</p>

<p>If you'd like to help me keep an eye out, you can check to see if the results are out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021035917/http://www.npc.navy.mil/Boards/ActiveDutyEnlisted/CPO+Selection+Boards.htm">here</a> (the Site requires Internet Explorer). When the results are released, the "FYO8 Selectees" link should be active.</p>

		<h2 class="bTitle">One more reason to make Chief...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I got an e-mail today from an old friend who I used to go to school with. Her name is Janae, and we went to middle school together. Apparently she has been following my blog for some time now. She wants to hook-up some time and catch up, and she said that if I make Chief she wants to take me to dinner. I guess this is one of the great parts of the internet, the ability to find and catch up with old friends. Janae is currently working in real estate. I think it's amazing to see what has become of people you went to school with as a child, and it's always nice to see that a friend is doing well...</p>

<p>Hopefully Janae will get to buy me that dinner...</p>

<p>She sent a picture, and gave me permission to share...<br/>

		<h2 class="bTitle">The waiting continues...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I wanted to start by thanking those of you who have written me e-mails of support, and those of you who have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021035917/http://myspace.com/tadpole256">contacted me on MySpace</a>. I really do appreciate all the support! </p>

<p>I continue to wait for the Chief results to come out, and the anticipation only builds because people are constantly asking me "are the results out yet?". What I think is worse is when someone who knows me asks "so did you make Chief?", don't you think I would mention it if I had been promoted? </p>

<p>A couple of people have mentioned that I seem a little anxious, and sometimes I seem a little cranky, and they are fairly certain it is because I am feeling testy about awaiting the results. They are probably right, but I hadn't realized I was showing it outwardly so much...</p>

<p>In the mean time I continue to try to keep busy, so in that vain, I will answer a few questions that I have been asked...</p>

<p>1) Yes, making Chief does mean that I will be getting a whole new "Wardrobe". Although we call them uniforms. This is good because it is distinguishing, and it will be the source of much pride if I do make it, but it is bad because it presents a sudden, very large expense.</p>

<p>2) No my new uniforms are not free! Not even close. In fact they are more expensive than my current uniforms. Whereas I will have to buy all new uniforms, I believe I will be extended some sort of a credit plan by the Navy Exchange to cover them all. Who would have thought that with a promotion could come extra debt?</p>

<p>3) Yes I am certain that I want to Stay Navy if I make Chief. It has been a life long dream, and I cannot possibly imagine any better job. It will be my honor to train and mentor future generations of sailors.</p>

<p>4) Yes I do intend to go through Chief's initiation, and I am looking forward to that "initiated &amp; proud" T-Shirt.</p>

<p>More updates as they occur...</p>			</div>

		<h2 class="bTitle">The waiting is killing me...</h2>
	<div class="bText">
		<p>I am currently waiting the results of the Chiefs board to see if I am going to be promoted to Chief Petty Officer. The wait is killing me. I have always wanted to be a Chief, for as long as I can remember I have wanted it. Now it may become a reality. But there is also a very real chance that it may not. This years chances are purportedly the worst chances in eight years.</p>

<p>What makes the wait worse is what I have riding on the decision... If I were merely waiting to find out whether or not I were being promoted, I would be anxious, but not this much. I've made a deal with my family. Most of my family thinks it's time for me to come out of the Navy. They feel I have served my time, and it's time for me to move on to bigger, better things. But they know I've always wanted to be a Chief. So I told them that if I make Chief I am definitely re-enlisting. But if I don't make it, I promised them a 90% I would get out.</p>

<p>I am not too concerned with worries of success... I feel confident that I will do well and be happy whether I stay Navy or if I get out and pursue something else. I just want to know which it is going to be, and the wait is killing me. I feel my entire life hangs in the balance.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I have been keeping busy. We have several ongoing projects at work, and we have a major inspection coming up soon. Plus I am enrolled full time in college, and should be graduating with a batchelors of science degree next spring. Combined with my attempts to build an ever more interesting social life, there is no doubt that I am a busy man. I feel I am setting myself up well to succeed no matter which path I wind up on, I just want to know which path to prepare for.</p>

<p>I'm optimistic... I am already working on my paperwork and plans for re-enlisting...</p>

<p>I will post more updates as they happen.</p>			</div>
