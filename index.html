<h1>Anthony McCloskey's GitHub Site</h1>
</div>
<p>This page is hosted on GitHub, and it is intended to be an accessory or sidecar page to my other projects.</p>
<p>Having been hosting a variety of sites on the Web for over 2 decades, means I've had a lot of domains, and a lot of hosts, which means that now I have also left behind a lot of broken links!</p>
<p>Some of those links were to various resources that were valuable and/or meaningful, at least to me. So the intent of this site, is to be a no-frills back-up to keep some of the content I value most online in some form.</p>
<p>It will undoubtedly change in style and format, hopefully for the better, as time goes on. But the main mission is to have a single long-lasting place to put some of my stuff.</p>
<br>
<p>Do with this as you will. <a href="mailto:comments@nordalai.com">Comments and questions</a> are always welcome.</p>
