<h1>What's with the name?</h1>
<br>
<p>I've had the online monniker <b>"tadpole256"</b> for a long time...<p>
<p>It's not a terribly interesting story. Basically, a long time ago, most user names and e-mail addresses were assigned by the service provider. My first ISP gave me the very clever username <b>"amc2748"</b>, not exactly the most memorable name. Later, when I got to choose a username, I wanted something memorable (by me and others), and something unique (like a brand).</p>
<h2> So why not just use some variation of my own name?</h2>
<p>It was less common in the 90's to just throw your real name out there on the internet for all to see. We still had some concern about privacy (or so we thought), and at the time the anonymity afforded by the internet was actually one of it's strengths. Trolls were not as pervasive then, and what we think of as <em>"cybercrime"</em> today did not really exist. There was also the appeal of having some kind of "handle" like in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk>Hackers</a>.
